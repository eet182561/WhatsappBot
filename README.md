This is a timepass project during the quarantine. My AIM is to make an API to send and receive messages through whatsapp so that one cane make bots using python.
More features will be added in the future. Current features include:
1. Open chat: Open the chat of the recipient using its name as saved in you phone.
2. Send message: With recipient name and message you can send message or in an open chat.

-> upcoming features
3. Get a list of active chats i.e. list of contacts/groups you have at least interacted with once.
